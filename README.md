# ToDo GitHub App Readme 📝

This repository contains a ToDo GitHub app developed using Flutter as a proof of concept. The app generates random "lorem ipsum" based todos to demonstrate its functionality. The "Add Todo" button code was even generated using a Figma plugin, showcasing the seamless integration between design and development. To run the app on your local machine, follow the steps below. ✅📌

## Getting Started 🚀

Before you start, make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. If not, you can download and set up Flutter by following the instructions on the official Flutter website: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) 📥🛠

### Cloning the Repository 📋

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:JoaoVitorAmorim/flutter_todo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd flutter_todo
   ```

### Running the App 🏃‍♂️

The app is developed using Flutter, and you will need to perform a few steps to set up and run the app.

1. Change to the `flutter_figma` directory:
   ```
   cd flutter_figma
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using Flutter's package manager:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Once the dependencies are installed, you can launch the app on an available emulator or physical device using the following command:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

   This command will build the app and launch it on the selected device. Make sure you have a device connected (or an emulator running) before using this command.

### Important: Code Generation and Figma Integration 🎨

**Files with names that end with `figma_mock` are designated to receive the generated code.** The "Add Todo" button code was also generated using a Figma plugin, highlighting the powerful integration between design assets and the Flutter codebase.

## Happy task managing with random "lorem ipsum" todos! 🎉📅📚
